Project summary:
                 SympTrace is a web-based health guidance system designed to help users understand their symptoms and identify the appropriate medical specialist. The platform allows users to enter symptoms and provides general health guidance without performing medical diagnosis. It also includes a BMI calculator to help users assess their body health status. Additionally, SympTrace offers basic insurance-related information for user awareness and a medicine ordering feature for convenience. The website is developed using HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript used only for button functionality. A consistent grid layout and typography are maintained across all pages to ensure a clean and simple design. The interface follows a white background theme to enhance readability and usability. SympTrace aims to provide preliminary guidance and support informed healthcare decisions.
